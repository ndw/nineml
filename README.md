# nineml

A family of Earley and Generalized LL (GLL) parsing tools.

This repository hosts the sources for
[CoffeeGrinder](https://coffeegrinder.nineml.org/),
[CoffeeFilter](https://coffeefilter.nineml.org/),
[CoffeeSacks](https://coffeesacks.nineml.org/),
[CoffeePot](https://coffeegpot.nineml.org/), and the main
[nineml.org](https://nineml.org/) website. These files used to be in
separate GitHub repositories, but have been consolidated into subprojects in
a single repository for convenience. The original repositories still exist,
partly to point here, but also to host the release packages and
pages for the individual websites.
