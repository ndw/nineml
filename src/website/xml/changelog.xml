<title>Unified NineML change log</title>
</info>

<para>This appendix is a unified change log for all of the NineML
components in this repository. It’s never formatted directly, it’s
distributed into the different component repositories during the
build. Having the source in a single place is an attempt to simplify
managing the change log. The log is used automatically in the release
notes for each component.</para>

<para>The unified log starts at version 3.0.0m. Previous history is in
the individual component <filename>changelogs.xml</filename> files.</para>

<para audience="coffeegrinder">Added an option to normalize line
endings.</para>

<para audience="coffeefilter"/> <!-- no changes -->

<para audience="coffeesacks"/> <!-- no changes -->

<para audience="coffeepot">Added a <option>--normalize</option> option
to enable normalizing line endings on the input. Also added a
<property>normalize-line-endings</property> configuration property.
Fixed a couple of serialization bugs where a newline was sometimes
missing before a closing tag when pretty printing was enabled and
where the “trailing newline on output” option was ignored.
