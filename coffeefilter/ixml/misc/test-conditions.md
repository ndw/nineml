# Test conditions for ixml parsers

This is a list of the conditions that I think need to be exhibited in positive test cases, in order to reach the grammatical equivalent of what Glenford J. Myers calls 'condition coverage'.  Condition coverage (in case you have misplaced your copy of Myers just for the moment) is a white-box coverage measure saying that for every condition tested in the code, there should be test cases making that condition take on each possible value at least once.  (So if you have code governed by IF A > 0 and B = 2, you need test cases for A > 0, A =< 0, B = 2, and B <> 2, which donâ€™t all need to be separate.)

With respect to positive test cases, I take the grammatical equivalent of that coverage level to be that for each RHS of a reachable nonterminal NT, expressions of the form shown below require tests as described:

- `E?`  (one *E*, no _E_)
- `E+` (one _E_, more than one _E_)
- `E*` (no _E_, one _E_, more than one _E_)
- `E; F` (NT is an _E_; NT is an _F_)
- `["ab"]` (NT is realized using "`a`"; NT is realized using "`b`")
- `["a" - "f"; "0" = "9"]` (NT is realized using something in the range "`a`" - "`f`"; NT is realized using the range "`0`" - "`9`")

Adding descriptions of negative test cases is relatively straightforward, but I did this exercise manually, not automatically, and I did not attempt to make a list of negative cases to be covered.  It produced a list of 87 conditions that should be exercised by positive test cases.

Because I worked manually, not automatically, I may well have glided over some things that should not be glided over, but for what it's worth, these are the conditions I noted.  Those marked !! are those that are *not* exhibited in the grammar of 9 June 2021 as I went through it just now.

To do:

- Automate generation of lists of this kind (from a grammar, generate a list of conditions to be tested in positive test cases).

- Automate generation of tool to examine a set of ixml test cases (specifically, the parse trees in the expected results) and produce a coverage report for the test case.
